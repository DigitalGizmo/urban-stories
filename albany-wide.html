			<h2>Displaced People</h2>
			<h1>The Reaction to Redevelopment</h1>

			<p>The State announces decision to seize 98.5 acres in downtown Albany for construction of new state office complex. City of Albany wakes up to learn the news—some that their homes now belong to the State and they will soon have to move</p>

				<p class="last-paragraph">On March 30, 1962, the Times Union editorial board urged readers, who harbored &ldquo;doubts&rdquo; about the wisdom of the State of New York&apos;s plan to seize and redevelop the South Mall area, to &ldquo;drive slowly—or walk—up and down these once proud streets. Then decide for yourself.&rdquo; The implication, of course, was that anyone who viewed the area firsthand would favor the State&apos;s plan. Beginning on the day the State announced its plan and continuing for the next several months, both the Times Union and Knickerbocker News published stories, editorials, and, perhaps most importantly, photographs designed to build the case for redevelopment.</p>

				<h3>The NAACP&apos;s response</h3>
				<p>"Had the mayor used half as much energy in fixing up the city and building the much needed housing as he is fighting the state, the mall situation might not have happened….</p>
				<p>"Anyone living in Albany, especially in the urban renewal areas, would tell you a really free election hasn&apos;t been held in these areas in the last 18 years.</p>
				<p>"Between threats of loss of welfare, raising of property taxes and loss of jobs by local politicians; a surplus of parking tickets and brutality from police; the bothersome and unnecessary visits of the infamous Night Squad, 90 per cent of these voters will, as always, vote the way the city officials want….</p>
				<p class="last-paragraph">&ldquo;This area contains one of the most populated Negro areas of the city. When this area goes, another 1,000 Negroes and Puerto Ricans who live in it will have to move into the already overcrowded areas left in the South End and up on Arbor Hill. And you know, they just might elect a member to the City Council and it won&apos;t be a Democrat.&rdquo;</p>

				<h3>The Business District</h3>
				<p>Hudson Ave was a mixed commercial/residential area. The businesses were geared toward serving the neighborhood&apos;s residents—restaurants, taverns, groceries, tailors, laundries, and shoe repair stores. One landmark business was the Eagle Theater where locals could see two full features, a newsreel, several cartoons, a weekly serial (wherein the hero prevails but new perils present themselves every week). The Eagle also hosted free bingo on weekends. Barry Levine remembers living, and working, in this neighborhood.</p>

				<h3>Residential District</h3>
				<p>There were very few single-family homes; most families rented out 1-2 rooms or apartments; scattered amongst the residences were small businesses, mainly corner stores, drug stores, and laundries. Cathedral area between Madison and Park, S. Swan and Eagle were heavily white areas populated by Catholics but with a growing population of Southern black migrants, tenants and homeowners, esp. on and around Jefferson St. Landmarks: Catholic grade school and high school. This area is adjacent to Lincoln Park.</p>
				<h3>The Leonard Family - Park Avenue</h3>
				<p class="last-paragraph">James (Jim) and Emma Leonard knew that they would have to move before the end of 1964. Yet they had hoped to spend one last Christmas in their 93 Park Avenue home. But on December 22—three days before Christmas—a McArdle & Casazza moving van arrived at their door, courtesy of the State of New York. So, while Jim was at work, Emma supervised the movers and packed up the car with kids and Christmas decorations. That day, the Leonard family became the last to leave the South Mall take area. They would celebrate the holidays in a new house on Hillcrest Avenue—with a puppy named Prince to go with the family&apos;s big new backyard.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="container20">
				<h3>The Office District</h3>
				<p>State St., across from the Capitol, was the site of lawyers&apos; and lobbyists&apos; offices. It also included some elegant homes and other small businesses, including the fabled Ambassador Tavern.</p>
				<h3>Marv and Ruthie Sherman - Elk Street</h3>
				<p class="last-paragraph">On March 31, 1962—4 days after the State of New York seized Albany&apos;s 98 acres— the Knickerbocker News &ldquo;Night Owl&rdquo; column reported that Ambassador owner Marvin J. Sherman and his regular customers were &ldquo;thinking of forming a Citizens Society to Exempt the Ambassador&rdquo; from demolition. The author quipped that a protest march emerging from the bar at 180 State Street, just across from the Capitol, would &ldquo;have the best starting point in history.&rdquo; In fact, such a protest would probably have received a sympathetic hearing from legislators of both parties. Along with lobbyists, newsmen, call girls, and a bookie known as &ldquo;Gaga,&rdquo; legislators were among the bar&apos;s most loyal customers.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="container21">
				<h3>The Market District</h3>
				<p class="last-paragraph">Grand and Philip/Hudson and Hamilton area was a mixed/commercial residential area. At its center was the farmer&apos;s market and retail/wholesale produce vendors. Landmarks: Lyon Block, First Methodist Church/Methodist Inner City Mission and French Catholic</p>
			</div>

			<div id="container22">
				<h3>The "Gut"</h3>
				<p class="last-paragraph">Area near the river and below S. Pearl St.  This area was both a factory/warehouse district and the location of a collection of single-room-occupancy hotels, flops, missions, and taverns. It was also where many European immigrants, and later Southern migrants, settled when they first arrived in Albany. Landmarks: the Salvation Army, the Palombi Hotel, former First Church of God in Christ (now Wilborn Temple), Burdick & Son factory.</p>
