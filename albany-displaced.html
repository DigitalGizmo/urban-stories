			<p>On March 27, 1962, the State of New York seized 98.5 acres (40 city blocks) in the heart of downtown Albany. The State&apos;s South Mall redevelopment project would displace roughly 7,000 people, hundreds of small businesses, 2 schools, and 4 churches—all to make way for construction of a massive modernist office and cultural complex. </p>

		<h2>The Immediate Response</h2>
	</div>

	<section id="chapter1">	

		<div class="narrative">	

			<p>Local newspaper editors immediately sent reporters out to collect man-on-the-street interviews from the South Mall area. The Albany Democratic Party organized a house-to-house canvass for the same purpose.</p>

			<p>The goals and methods of reporters and political operatives differed dramatically. Owned by the same publisher, Albany&apos;s two local newspapers backed the State&apos;s South Mall plan with pro-development editorials and stories.  Reporters targeted an area characterized by small businesses and transient residents, where they found support for, or at least acceptance of, the State plan. By contrast, the Democratic canvassers catalogued opposition to the South Mall amongst an aging population of owner-occupiers and long-term tenants, active in the Catholic Church and loyal to the party&apos;s leadership. Both sets of interviews are skewed, but together, they provide a broader picture of how residents and business owners responded to news of their imminent dispossession. Some greeted the news with optimism, others with anxiety. Overall, a sense of inevitability prevailed.</p>

		<div class="narrative">
			
			<p>The South Mall was unlike most other urban renewal project in the United States. It was a state-initiated plan imposed on a reluctant city with minimal input from local leaders. Albany Mayor Erastus Corning promptly denounced the South Mall plan and brought suit to prevent its implementation. Having just won a sixth term as mayor, he had a 20-year history of fighting off Republican governors&apos; attempts to intervene in the capital city&apos;s affairs. Q: &ldquo;What is your opinion of the state&apos;s land seizure?&rdquo; A: &ldquo;Well I think it&apos;s a tragedy to the people living in the area. There are very, very good buildings, many people owned their own homes for many years, the relocation problem is staggering&hellip;.&rdquo;.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Corning told the reporters he had received hundreds of letters applauding his opposition to the State plan. Business- and homeowners, Elinor and Leo Mullen, praised the mayor&apos;s efforts to prevent seizure of their property and destruction of the tightknit community in which they lived. She wrote, &ldquo;We hope and pray that God will give you the strength to fight against this communistic method for improving the city of Albany&hellip;.&rdquo; Patricia Beaupre, likewise, called on the mayor to protect her family and neighbors. &ldquo;What good are these monuments,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;The people won&apos;t be around to see them, if the houses keep being torn down&hellip;. [T]here won&apos;t be anyplace for the people to live. Even tearing down new high schools. Please don&apos;t let Governor Rockefeller do these cruel things to us.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Nelson A. Rockefeller, scion of one the nation&apos;s wealthiest families, aspired to be the nation&apos;s &ldquo;buildingest governor.&rdquo; An architect-manqué, the South Mall was his brainchild. Before taking office, Rocky had played a key role in the design and construction of Rockefeller Center, the Museum of Modern Art, and the United Nations Headquarter in New York City. As governor, he was responsible for a dramatic expansion the state&apos;s highway and university systems.</p>

			</div>

			<p>To the Governor and his supporters, Albany appeared blighted and in need of revitalization, and they blamed the city&apos;s Democratic leadership. Chairman of the local opposition party, Citizens United Reform Effort (CURE), Gren Rand characterized Mayor Corning&apos;s stand on the South Mall as &ldquo;starkly political.&rdquo; The Democratic machine, he argued, &ldquo;thrives on decay and deterioration and the miseries of the people.&rdquo; Rule by favors and threats had its greatest impact on the city&apos;s poorest residents, and as NAACP official and South Mall resident Harry Vodery pointed out, African Americans bore the brunt of both threats and decay. [pop up sidebar on the $5 vote and threats listed in Harry Vodery speech]</p>

			<p>South Mall boosters argued that reconstruction would beautify Albany and bolster the city&apos;s flagging fortunes. The majority of South Mall residents appeared to agree, based on a CURE poll from the summer of 1962. Over the course of a week, 30 volunteers knocked on doors throughout redevelopment area, asking two questions:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Is the South Mall redevelopment project good for Albany</li>
				<li>Is it good for you and your family?</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Of 1,386 adults polled, 956 or 70% answered yes to the first question. More than half (717) answered yes to the second.</p>

			<p>And yet the results of the South Mall poll were less than straightforward, as Hal Juhre explained in an open letter to Mayor Corning and Gov. Rockefeller. Quote: &ldquo;&hellip;.Many of the affected residents—60 of whom I interviewed during the recent CURE survey—are confused and concerned as to how the project will affect people. Will it enhance human welfare and dignity or lead to human misery? The most recurrent theme was &lsquo;I&apos;m all in favor of progress, so long as no one gets hurt.&apos;&hellip;.&rdquo; Rather than wholesale clearance, Juhre proposed rehabilitation with an emphasis on housing. He pointed out that while the area had deteriorated under Democratic leadership, many of the structures were still sound.</p>

			<p>Within the area slated for demolition, South Mall supporters found run-down rentals, broken sidewalks, and vacant storefronts. Critics rightly pointed to the churches, family homes, and profitable businesses in different sections of the redevelopment area. Where and why they looked determined what they saw. Within the 98 acres, there were several distinct neighborhoods.</p>

		<h2>Designing the South Mall</h2>

			<p>Lorem ipsum for now</p>
		</div>

		<div class="narrative">
			
			<p>On June 29, 1962, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled against the City’s attempt to stop the South Mall. Two weeks later on July 11, demolition began with a press event featuring Gov. Rockefeller behind the controls of a 60-ton crane. He ceremonially removed the first bucket of bricks and handed them out as souvenirs to the crowd of onlookers. This event marked the beginning of site clearance, the two-and-a-half year process of removing roughly 7,000 people and razing 1,141 structures. </p>

			</div>

			<p> Even before demolition began, the State hired a team of architects to design the South Mall. Lead among them, Wallace K. Harrison, was known for his work on some of New York City’s most celebrated buildings, among them Rockefeller Center, the Metropolitan Opera House, and the United Nations Headquarters. Harrison’s reputation lent luster to the state project, but his close personal and professional ties to the governor raised concerns about a conflict of interest. </p>

			<p>Untrained as an architect, Rocky played an unusually active role in the design of the South Mall. His (literally) back-of-the envelope concept sketch, inspired by Potala Palace high above Lhasa, Tibet, would become the basis of the massive modernist office and cultural complex most commonly compared to the Brazilian capital of Brasilia. Indeed, the governor’s aesthetic stamp marked the very foundation of the South Mall, the half-mile long, quarter-mile wide platform connecting the Capitol to the Governor’s Mansion. This “great wall,” according to Harrison, was intended to “separate the Mall into a kind of community.” </p>

		<div class="narrative">
			
			<p>On April 23, 1963, nine months after demolition began, the State’s South Mall plan was finally unveiled at a press event in the Capitol Rotunda. Reviews in the local newspapers were uniformly positive. (After all, the publisher was a member of the Temporary State Commission on the Capital City.) “Impressive, dramatic, marvelous, terrific, pleasing, magnificent and thrilling” were the comments recorded by one Times Union reporter. Mayor Corning enthused, “As I look at this magnificent model, I consider it the most significant day in the entire history of Albany and of the State…. I will do everything in my power to see that it becomes a reality as quickly and in as fine a fashion as is humanly possible.”</p>

			</div>

			<p>Outside of Albany, reviews of the $250 million (estimated) capitol complex were considerably less kind. Mostly famously, an unsigned critique in the influential journal Progressive Architecture dismissed the South Mall design as “an exercise in architectural pop art.” The reviewer blamed the governor and his enablers for its faults. Despite pushback from Rockefeller supporters, the journal’s editor stood by the critique, especially criticism of the governor’s role in the design process. “Quite a few architects are disturbed by this approach to planning,” he said. “Albany deserves the best, and I don’t think it is getting the best.”</p>

			<p>Despite criticism, the South Mall project moved inexorably forward.  By end of 1963, the majority of area residents had moved out, and demolition was more than halfway complete.</p>
