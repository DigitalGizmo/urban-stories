			<h2>Displaced People</h2>
			<h3>The Reaction to Redevelopment</h3>

			<p>The State announces decision to seize 98.5 acres in downtown Albany for construction of new state office complex. City of Albany wakes up to learn the news—some that their homes now belong to the State and they will soon have to move</p>

			<p>We might use the frontpage of the Times Union and/or Knick News, editorial cartoons as illustrations.</p>

				<h2>Man-on-the-street interviews</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3>John Johnson, James Strawn, and George Kemp</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>John Johnson: “These houses are old. I think it would be swell to tear these buildings down.”</p>

				<p>James Strawn agreed that “tearing down ‘these 50 and 60-year-old buildings might make for some decent places in which to live.’”</p>

				<p class="last-paragraph">George Kemp: “This would be a pretty good deal if they included some housing projects too.”</p>

			</div>	

			<div  id="container2">
				<h3>Lillian Pierce</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>"How is it going to help downtown? Naturally, we don’t want to move. Even the news may scare my people away. And they’ve been coming her for years.</p>
				<p class="last-paragraph">"Everyone’s talking about this. Even the grocer up the street on Hawk Street. He wants to move out now instead of waiting."</p>

			</div>
					
			<div  id="container3">
				<h3>John Sgarlata</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p class="last-paragraph">"Thirty years ago this market was open day and night. The Menands Market opened. That killed this. Then Park &amp; Shop opened. That and the automobile killed the rest of the farmer trade. I’m an old guy. I’ll be 67 in August. I’m retired practically already and my son, Frank, will be in charge."</p>

			</div>

			<div  id="container4">
				<h3>Elinor Mullen</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p class="last-paragraph">After opening the Cathedral Shop over 5 years ago and building up the business, now they are moving the whole congregation including my business and my home, the place I spent hundreds of dollars to make it comfortable, intending to spend the rest of my life here with my family including my invalid father who is over 80 and has lived in this neighborhood all his life. Where am I going? I think it is unfair and an outrage.</p>

			</div>

			<div  id="container5">
				<h3>Leonora Blodgett</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>I don’t like it at all. It came so fast I don’t know what to do. This rooming house is my sole means of support. It will be a terrible hardship. I can’t go out and get a job at my age.</p>
				<p class="last-paragraph">. . . . It is going to be a great hardship on me at my age to sell this place because no matter what they give me when I settle the mortgage no this place I won’t have much left. . . .</p>

			</div>

			<div  id="container6">
				<h3>Viola Williams</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p class="last-paragraph">I have been worried since I heard that the State is going to dispossess us. I don’t know what to do because trying to find a home for colored people is almost impossible. I would like to remain here.</p>
